      <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
      <p>These Terms of Service govern your use of LEST TAXI and our transportation services. By booking or riding with us, you agree to these terms. If you do not agree, please refrain from using our services.</p>
      <p>Bookings may be made online or by phone. Please ensure all details are accurate; you are responsible for providing correct pickup and drop‑off information. Prices are communicated before confirmation, and payment can be made via the accepted methods listed on our website or directly to the driver. We may refuse or cancel rides for safety reasons, abusive behavior, fraud concerns, or non‑payment.</p>
      <p>We always aim to be punctual, but traffic, weather, and operational factors can affect timing. LEST TAXI is not liable for indirect or consequential losses arising from delays or missed connections. Passengers must comply with local laws and our safety instructions (for example, using seat belts and respecting vehicle cleanliness). Damage caused to vehicles may be charged to the responsible party.</p>
      <p>Cancellations and changes are subject to our policy communicated at booking; certain bookings may have cut‑off times or fees. We process personal data in line with our Privacy Policy. These terms may be updated to reflect changes in our services or legal requirements. Material changes will be posted on this page.</p>
      <h2>Contact</h2>
